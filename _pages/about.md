I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at Politecnico di Milano.
I work on the development of MARCO, a novel MLIR compiler for the (Base) Modelica language.
On a broader perspective, I am interested in topics related to compilation, modeling, and simulation technologies.
Personal interests include, but are not limited to, the automotive and aerospace sectors.

For any question, feel free to contact me at michele.scuttari@polimi.it
